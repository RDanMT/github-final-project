# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple command-line application (or script) that calculates the interest earned or paid over a specific period.

## Formula
The calculator uses the standard simple interest formula:
$A = P(1 + rt)$

Where:
* **P** = Principal amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* **r** = Annual interest rate (decimal)
* **t** = Time the money is invested or borrowed for (years)

## How to Use
1. Enter the **Principal** amount.
2. Enter the **Annual Interest Rate** (e.g., 5 for 5%).
3. Enter the **Time** in years.
4. The system will output the total interest and the final balance.

## Features
- Fast and accurate calculations.
- Easy-to-read output.
- Support for decimal interest rates.
